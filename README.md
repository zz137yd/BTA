# BTA
Windows file manager, used together with Windows' own file explorer.

Qt version : 5.14.2

1.Favorites mechanism. Include four favorites: work, personal, key, and leisure, for easy access.You can regard Favorites as a small file manager.

2.Size progress bar. Clearly see the size of each file and folder. 
The first load takes a few seconds, then it will be displayed immediately and only the size of new files will be calculated. The user experience is not bad.

3.Dual file views, the left side is used for various operations, and the right side view is the parent directory on the left.

4.After testing, the i5-9600KF can run smoothly. 
In addition to the 6-core 6-thread CPU, I also plan to test the feasibility of running BTA on 4-core 8-thread, 4-core 4-thread, 2-core 4-thread, and FX series CPUs.
